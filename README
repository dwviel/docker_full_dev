Build and run full development environment docker container.

Emacs and VIM are currently supported. Add other development tools to Dockerfile as needed.

Allows for ssh into docker container and display of X11 from container to host machine. Similar to ssh to a VM for development.

Container has permissions to allow http and https out to repos. All artifacts should be persisted to a repo and the container viewed as evanescent.


Build container:
docker build -f Dockerfile -t full_dev:0.1 .

Run container:
docker run -it --rm --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -P -p 127.0.0.1:8022:22 -h full_dev:0.1 full_dev:0.1
* port is 8022 from host machine. Change as needed for actual host.

To access from host:
ssh -X fulldev@localhost -p 8022
